v0.5.2
- Slightly improved handling of fixed offsets.

v0.5.1
- If LMAO writes debugging information, it reserves memory cells for
  unused commands "?-" (considers them as "?").
  This may make Malbolge programs a litte bit larger, but debugging
  them with HeLL IDE becomes a bit easier.

v0.5
- LMAO can write debugging information now (e.g. for HeLL IDE)

v0.4.4
- Added @ (short for .OFFSET) and braces for block identification to HeLL
- Added line numbers to error messages

v0.4.3
- Decreased size of generated programs a little bit

v0.4.2
- Added support for calculation operators with label names

v0.4.1
- Added command line argument for line length
- Command line argument for output file name is not required any more
- Decreased size of generated programs a little bit
- Doxygen documentation
- Fixed bugs

v0.4
- Added operators for constant calculation
- Changed symbol for unused memory cell from "-" to "?-"
- Added support for Strings in HeLL program files

v0.3.2
- Decreased size of generated programs

v0.3.1
- Fixed a bug

v0.3
- Added new data module for constant generation to decrease size of
  (complex) programs

v0.2.1
- Decreased size of generated programs

v0.2
- Decreased size of generated programs

v0.1.1
- Fixed a bug that may occur if .OFFSET is used in the code section
- Added example code in HeLL for a cat program that halts on EOF

v0.1
- Basic implementation
